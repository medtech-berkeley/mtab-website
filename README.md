MTAB WEBSITE

Structure:
- index.html: landing page / home page
- about.html: names and faces of current leadership, information and pictures of general meetings

- pathways.html: information about nmep, embark-mt, innovationRx and fellow pathway, information about sector
- projects.html: information about our past and current projects in Incubator

Open issues:
- index.html:
    - fix gross button feature on landing pages
    - cooler animations
    - rotating DNA in background of landing image
- about.html:
    - update with current leadership roster, pictures, and titles
    - organize this info in a visually appealing way on the page
    - club community pictures
    - other club info (we should decide whether to put GM pictures here or somewhere else)
- pathways.html:
    - tracks: nmep vs fellow
    - nmep options: cohort program, EMBARK-MT, innovationRx
    - sectors and sector info (maybe make this its own page and make pathways for edu)
- projects.html:
    - feature a few cool projects and (possibly) link to github
    - can temporarily link to our wordpress projects website
